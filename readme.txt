**Invalidate selected (or all) coupons for selected user roles** - This will invalidate selected (or all) coupons for selected user roles. Coupon code input field will still be available on the cart and checkout pages. In case if user with "wrong" user role will try to apply the coupon, plugin will display customizable "Coupon is not valid for your user role" message on frontend.
